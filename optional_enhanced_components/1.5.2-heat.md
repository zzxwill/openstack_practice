Heat is a service to orchestrate composite cloud applications using a declarative template format through an OpenStack-native REST API.  
Heat是一个基于OpenStack REST API使用申明型模板来编排云计算应用的服务。



## Heat架构

Heat由一系列的Python应用组成：

### heat

The heat tool is a CLI which communicates with the heat-api to execute AWS CloudFormation APIs. Of course this is not required—developers could also use the Heat APIs directly.

heat是一个命令行工具。

### heat-api

The heat-api component provides an[OpenStack-native ReST API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-orchestration-v1.html)that processes API requests by sending them to the heat-engine over RPC.

### heat-api-cfn

The heat-api-cfn component provides an AWS-style Query API that is compatible with AWS CloudFormation and processes API requests by sending them to the heat-engine over RPC.

### heat-engine

The heat engine does the main work of orchestrating the launch of templates and providing events back to the API consumer.
